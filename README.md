# Lemonade-Stand-Game

## How to play
1. Buy ingredients.
2. Make lemonade.
3. Sell lemonade.
4. Random events may happen everyday.
5. Lemonade prices will fluctuate everyday.

## What I learned
1. I used everything that I learned in Comp 110 (Intro to Computer Science) when I made this which includes conditional statements, loops, arrays, switch cases, method structures and file read/write.
2. Rudimentary save/load system using file read/write that inputs each line in a file into a variable.

## Notes
If I had a chance to do this again, I would implement object oriented programming because a lot of main file could have been sectioned off. I think this was a really good side project which really helped me fully understand the material that was being taught at the time.
